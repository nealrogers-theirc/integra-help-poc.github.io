    <p>Integra has a tool for importing credit card transactions from a statement. This is used for Corporate Credit cards and for Procurement cards (P-cards). Once transactions are imported into Integra, they are attached to an expense report and charged to the correct project and category, along with the applicable financial dimensions.</p>
    <p>P-card transactions and RESCUE Corporate Card transactions must be added and coded on separate expense reports. Do not combine these transactions on the same report.</p>

    <p>IRC employees request reimbursement for out-of-pocket intercompany expenses.</p>
    <p>Intercompany expense lines are created when an expense is incurred on behalf of another main office. Sub-offices in the same reporting entity in Integra do not require an intercompany expense line. There are two types of intercompany expenses:</p>
    <p class="Numbering131">Intercompany expense to record expense in another reporting entity:</p>
    <p class="Numbering132" data-list-level="2">Both offices are on Integra</p>
    <p class="Numbering131">Interim intercompany expense:</p>
    <p class="Numbering132" data-list-level="2">Expense incurred for a reporting entity that is not yet live on Integra.</p>
    <p class="Numbering132" data-list-level="2">Uses ICCO to indicate the interim company.</p>
    <p class="Numbering132" data-list-level="2">The destination company is identified in this expense line.</p>
