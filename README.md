# onelogin-pages-test
Testing if it's feasible to have a pure-frontend site with onelogin authorization working on github pages. This test project was developed based on OneLogin's "Implicit Flow" example: https://github.com/onelogin/onelogin-oidc-node/tree/master/2.%20Implicit%20Flow

Configuration specifics can be found in the README.md of https://github.com/ZippoLag/onelogin-pages-test/tree/dev
