  <p>Receipt of non-stock products</p>

  <p>Stock products are received and tracked inventory, i.e., on-hand balances are updated with each goods movement<br/>
    ‎</p>
  <p>Non-stock products are not tracked in inventory. Upon receipt of non-stock items, the items are immediately expensed to a project.</p>
  <h6 class="Heading6">Note: Services are received the same way non-stock items are received.</h6>
  <p>A partial quantity of a PO may be received. In these situations, the PO remains open until all items are received.<br/>
