    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Process_Changes_with_Integra
"></a>Process Changes with Integra</h2>
    <p>All budget amendments, whether they require donor approval or not, and regardless of the value and complexity, are processed in Integra</p>
    <p>Budget holders play a larger role in the budget revision process</p>
    <p>There is a standardized Budget Development Template used for preparing and amending Integra budget upload files</p>
    <p>All budget revisions are submitted to workflow for approval</p>
    <p>After workflow approval is complete, Finance posts all amended budgets to the budget register in Integra.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="General_Guidelines_for_Amendments"></a>General Guidelines for Amendments</h2>
    <p>Project amendments follow a similar business process flow as project setup.</p>
    <p>Budget holders and designates have a responsibility to provide Finance with revised budgets. They are responsible for completing the standard Budget Development Template with all the changes to be made to the budget.</p>
    <p>Project budget amendments are subject to workflow approval.</p>
    <p>For restricted projects at HQ, all budgets submitted to workflow are approved by the PQU Support group in Finance.</p>
    <p>For all unrestricted projects and those temporary restricted projects at HQ managed by FP&amp;A, FP&amp;A submit all budgets to workflow within their group. Budget workflows are approved by the Senior Director, Financial Planning and Analysis.</p>
    <p>For the remaining temporary restricted projects at HQ managed by the Finance - PQU Support group, all budgets submitted to workflow are approved by this group.</p>
    <p>For CRRD and RAI, Finance submits budgets to workflow and they are approved by the Finance Controller or designate.</p>
    <p>For offices using Integra, A D1 extension is required for all sub-award sub projects, regardless of the sub-award budget value. For those offices not using Integra, the process below does not apply.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The D1 extension for all sub awards is initially created by Finance HQ in OTIS and is automatically transferred to Integra via the OTIS/Integra system interface.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">CRRD/RAI field offices will no longer create sub award identifier locally themselves for sub awards less than $25,000 USD.</span></p>
    <h6 class="Heading6">Note: For those offices not using Integra, the abovementioned process does not apply and those offices will continue to create their own sub award identifier for sub awards &lt;$25,000 USD until such time as they deploy Integra.</h6>
    <p class="null">Funding limits are not applicable to unrestricted and temporary restricted projects.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Roles_and_Responsibilities_Matrix"></a>Roles and Responsibilities Matrix</h2>
    <p><img alt="C:\Users\shannont\AppData\Local\Temp\SNAGHTMLd6f4cfbf.PNG" height="531.0" src="assets/images/UG_PRJ_Project Amendments_QA_files/image1.png" width="673.7"/></p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Amendments_Initiated_in_OTIS"></a>Amendments Initiated in OTIS</h2>
    <p class="ListParagraph">The OTIS process for D1 updates is the same as before Integra</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Amendments typically initiated in OTIS include:</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Restricted Projects where the change requires donor approval.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Temporary Restricted Projects where there is a change in the receiving unit (D4 – HQ Unit/D5 – CRRD/RAI field legal entity) regardless of whether donor approval is required or not.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Multi-entity Projects (Restricted and Temporary restricted funding) regardless of whether donor approval is required or not, particularly when there is a change in the receiving unit (D4 – HQ Unit/D5 – CRRD/RAI field legal entity). This ensures that the updated award/obligated amounts are reflected accurately in each Integra entity.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Sub award sub projects where a new sub award is added to the parent project or there is an amendment to sub award budgets. This would apply to all sub award sub projects regardless of the funding source and whether donor approval is required or not.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">For amendments processed in OTIS, the following fields on the D1 overview page transfer to Integra:</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">End date</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Total obligated amount</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Total award amount</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Receiving units (D4 and/or D5 financial dimension).</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">The D5 receiving unit determines the Integra legal entity to which the project information from the OTIS interface is sent.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">The D4 receiving unit determines which HQ D4, within the HQ Integra legal entity, is allocated funds for the project. It is important to note that while OTIS holds each budget allocation by D4, Integra only brings over the Total budget amount.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">For sub award sub projects initiated in OTIS, the following fields from the sub award D1 extension page transfer to Integra:</p>
    <ul class="Disc">
      <li class="ListParagraph">D1 Extension/Sub-Project ID</li>
      <li class="ListParagraph">Legal Entity/Company</li>
      <li class="ListParagraph">Project Name and Sub-award Vendor</li>
      <li class="ListParagraph">Actual Start Date </li>
      <li class="ListParagraph">Actual End Date </li>
      <li class="ListParagraph">Total Award Amount </li>
      <li class="ListParagraph">Obligated Amount </li>
      <li class="ListParagraph">Change in project stage</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ListParagraph">When the budget revision checkbox is flagged on the D1 update in OTIS, there is an automatic update to the project stage in Integra (from ‘Active’ to ‘Budget Revision’). The change in the project stage alerts Finance that a project budget revision has been processed in OTIS and is ready to be updated in Integra.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">When Finance finalizes the posting of the revised budget register entry, adds new project categories (if applicable) and amends the funding limits (if applicable), the project stage must be changed back to ‘Active’.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">If a project amendment does not include a change in the budget, the project stage remains ‘Active’ in Integra.<br/>
      ‎</p>
    <h6 class="Heading6">Note: When a project was created in OTIS with the incorrect legal entity, and the correction is made in OTIS, the correction does not flow through to Integra. Therefore, Integra must be manually updated to remove the wrong project from Integra.</h6>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Amendments_Not_Initiated_in_OTIS"></a>Amendments Not Initiated in OTIS</h2>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Budget re-alignments not requiring donor approval are not typically managed in OTIS. These would include:</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Restricted Projects – those single entity projects where, if required and approved, the same process is followed in Integra as other amendment types, however, they are not typically initiated in OTIS. E.g., an office has a USAID grant and they want to move budget lines between Health and Protection or from one field site to another field site.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Temporary Restricted Projects – those projects in one D4 and/or D5 that have a budget change not requiring donor approval.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Unrestricted Projects – managed by the FP&amp;A unit directly in Integra.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Multi- Entity Projects –whilst these projects are implemented in multiple legal entities, when there is a change to a single entity budget that does not require donor approval and does not change budget allocations per receiving unit i.e D5 and/or D4.</p>
    <h6 class="Heading6">Note: Finance still needs to approve all internal amendments to any budget and its funding limits before uploading to Integra.</h6>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="The_Budget_Development_Template"></a>The Budget Development Template</h2>
    <p class="ListParagraph">The Budget Development Template is a standardized template used to develop and amend project budgets.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">The Budget Development Template is used for amending all project budgets - restricted, unrestricted, and temporary restricted.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">There are two Integra budget development template folders available on Box:</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Standard Project Category Template</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Unique Project Category Template</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Ensure you are using the correct template!</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">All unrestricted projects use standard project categories</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Temporary restricted may use either standard or unique project categories; this is a judgment call based on the specific project.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Restricted projects may use unique or standard project categories. Examples of when each would be used are listed below.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">US Gov – use standard project categories</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">European (ECHO funding) - use unique project categories</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">The templates have numerous macros and formulas that streamline the population of the project templates that get uploaded to Integra.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">There are guiding user instructions built into each sheet and column of the template.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">The main types of budget revisions done in the Budget Development Template include the following:</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Adding or removing budget lines (project categories)</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Re-allocating budget amounts between existing budget lines</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Adding or removing a sub-project</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">The revised budget information provided to Finance is captured within the Input tab sheet and the Data Source sheet of the Budget Development Template.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2">Addition of Sub-award Sub-project as Amendment</h2>
    <p class="ListParagraph">When a sub award was not final when the parent project was initially set up, but details are now known, the parent project requires an amendment to include the sub-award sub-project budget at the level of detail required.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Once sub award budget details are known, the sub award agreement has been processed and the D1 extension code has been issued in OTIS, a sub-project is created in Integra with sub award information from OTIS. The partner name assigned to the sub award in OTIS is linked to the sub-awardee vendor name in Integra.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">At this point, finance needs to reverse the placeholder lump sum budget line out of the parent project and add detailed budget lines to the sub project</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Main account 76000 is used for sub-awards totaling less than $25,000.00.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">Main account 76001 is used for sub-awards totaling greater than $25,000.00</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">When setting up the sub award budget as part of the sub project (D1_extension), the sub award budget in Integra should reflect the actual detailed sub award budget.</p>
    <p class="ListParagraph">In most cases, the detailed sub award budget follows the IRC budget categories and these should also be used to distinguish between sub award salaries, benefits, travel, equipment, program supplies, administrative costs etc.</p>
    <h2 class="Heading2"><a id="Populate_the_Budget_Development_Template_for_Amendment_1"></a>Populate the Budget Development Template for Amendment</h2>
