  <h1><a id="Setting up Clients as Vendors in Integra"></a>Setting up Clients as Vendors in Integra</h1>
  <p>In Integra, the details of all persons and organizations with whom the IRC interacts with are stored in the global address book. The BENE Vendor group relates to any person who is targeted for assistance, who directly benefits from or comes in contact with an IRC-implemented or financially-supported IRC program.</p>
  <p>Most clients are automatically created in Integra through the ETO (Efforts to Outcome) interface; however, non-ETO clients who do not need heightened confidentiality (i.e., their name being saved in Integra is acceptable) can be manually entered and approved by the local requestor. Examples of a requestor include but are not limited to the following roles:</p>
  <ul class="List10" data-start="1" xmlns="">
    <li>Caseworker</li>
    <li>Casework Supervisor</li>
    <li>Resettlement Manager</li>
    <li>Anti-Trafficking Manager</li>
    <li>Finance Manager</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the office has a program(s) where clients require heightened confidentiality, Finance will create a generic vendor record in the Vendor module. This is done during the project set-up phase. Example of a such a vendor includes anti-trafficking clients.  Due to the sensitivity of this vendor type and to ensure the record is secured to the legal entity, only those with permission can view the record. </p>
  <h3>The D9 Financial Dimension</h3>
  <ul class="List9" data-start="1" xmlns="">
    <li>One client can have multiple D9 financial dimensions if enrolled in multiple programs.</li>
    <li>When processing client payment requests, it is critical that the correct D9 is selected, as this is how Integra and ETO track what is spent on each collection and individual client.</li>
    <li>For client payments where the vendor selected is not the principal applicant, the D9 dimension value is the collection/case number. This number is linked to the principal applicant’s name.</li>
    <li>For anti-trafficking clients, before requesting the first payment, the client ID (D9) must be created in Integra. When requesting the payment, select the generic vendor record as the vendor.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><img alt="Picture 96" height="350.8" src="assets/images/rh_import-UG_Requesting Client Payments in Integra_files/image1.png" width="692.1"/></h4>
  <p>Process Overview</p>
  <ol class="List25" data-start="1" xmlns="">
    <li>Caseworker enters client payment request in Integra.</li>
    <li>Caseworker submits payment request to workflow for approval.</li>
    <li>Once approved by supervisor and Finance, caseworker prints hard copy of payment request.</li>
    <li>Finance posts the payment request.</li>
    <li>Finance processes payment in Integra.
      <ol>
        <li>The client’s date of birth is required for payment. Refer to the procedure in this document titled, Display List of Direct Assistance Cases for instructions on finding this information.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Caseworker gives prepaid card (or check) to client (or vendor, when applicable) and obtains client signature on hard copy printout of payment request.</li>
    <li>Caseworker attaches electronic copy of signed document to payment request journal in Integra.</li>
    <li>Caseworker files hardcopy in client’s folder.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><br/>
    ‎Recommended Follow-on Steps</p>
  <ul class="List21" data-start="1" xmlns="">
    <li>Caseworker verifies that the remaining budget has been updated on the Client Payment Dashboard.</li>
    <li>Caseworker ensures that payment transferred to ETO.</li>

  <h1><a id="Display_List_of_Direct_Assistance_Cases"></a>Display List of Direct Assistance Cases</h1>
  <p>Purpose</p>
  <p>Use this procedure to determine/view the following:</p>
  <p>The list of clients that have come over from ETO, and in which programs they are enrolled. This helps determine the case number to use to process the payment request.</p>
  <p>The invoice journals (payment requests) posted for a client.</p>
  <p>View the date of birth for a client</p>
  <p>The finance manager requires the date of birth to load a customer card.</p>
  <p>Note: The table grid can be personalized to add/remove and move columns. Refer to the procedure directly after this procedure for instructions on personalizing a grid.</p>
  <p>Steps</p>
  <p>Navigate to Project management and accounting <span></span> Projects <span></span> Direct assistance cases. You can also access this page by searching “Direct assistance cases” in the search bar at the top of the screen.</p>

  <p>Navigate to the Vendor account column in the grid. (Scroll to the right to see all columns)</p>
  <p>Click a vendor account number to open the vendor master record.</p>
  <p>On the action pane near the top of the form, under the Vendor tab, click Transactions to view a list of posted journals.</p>
  <p>Note: There will be two entries for each payment that has been completed. Those vouchers starting with “AP” reflect the invoice journals (initiated by caseworkers) and those with “PV” are those vendor payment journals completed by Finance used to process the client payment.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Result</p>
  <p>You have displayed a list of clients and their enrolment programs. You have also viewed invoice journals (payment requests) posted for a client.</p>

  <h1><a id="Process_Payment_Request_for_a_Client"></a>Process Payment Request for a Client</h1>
  <p>Purpose</p>
  <p>Use this procedure to enter a client payment request journal in Integra.</p>
  <p>Each payment request journal requires two lines: a vendor line and a project line.</p>
  <p>Note: If you are including multiple vendor lines in one journal (all using the same Client ID), each vendor line must have a corresponding project line.</p>
  <p>There are different financial dimension requirements for each line in the payment request journal:</p>
  <p>Vendor line requires D1, D4, and D5</p>
  <p>Project line requires D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6 and D9</p>

  <h2><a id="Requesting_Client_Payment_for_Minor_Clients_(under_18_years)"></a>Requesting Client Payment for Minor Clients (under 18 years)</h2>
  <h2>Minor clients are enrolled in ETO program (typically workforce development, youth or safety and wellness).</h2>
  <h2>The minor client is created via the ETO/Integra interface and appears on the direct assistance case table.</h2>
  <h2>As the client is under 18, no vendor record is created. We do not manually create these records as there is an anticipation that the record will be created automatically when the client turns 18 and we do not want duplicates.</h2>
  <h2>To make a payment directly to the minor child, the generic client record is selected as the vendor record (e.g., Atlanta Client) and the correct client ID is tagged to the transaction using the same steps as any other client payment.</h2>
  <h2>As long as the correct ETO Program is tagged to the Project ID and the correct D9 is selected, this transaction should flow over to ETO, the same as any third party payment</h2>
