Do the order quantities and unit prices support partial receipt and invoicing of the service? Services are sometimes based on a time period (i.e. unit of measure for hour, weekly, month or year) and services are delivered by that time period (think of a grant writer charging by the hour). Sometimes services are delivered based on a body of work. For example, a translator may be hired to translate 10 documents, but agrees to provide them 2 at a time. For events, it is common to make multiple payments prior to the event. If the order is for an event with an order quantity of 1 and a unit price of $12,000, that would not support multiple receipts and multiple payments. But if the purchase order was changed to show an order quantity of 2 and a unit price of $6,000, this would support doing 2 receipts and 2 payments, while leaving the overall value of the order unchanged","\n    ","Once the PO is approved, it can then either physically be mailed or emailed to the vendor.","\n    ","Learning objectives:","\n    ","\n      ","Submit Purchase Order for Approval","\n      ","Access Approved Purchase Order and Confirm in System","\n    ","\n    "],["\n    ","An additional alert displays when the funding limit has exceeded 100% of the budget.
